Choose Function
Choose(2,"dog","cat")
purpose choose a value or action to perform from a list of values
value contained at the index provided
The choose function can  be used to select (lookup) more than just values
It can be  used to select numbers, text,cell,references,
defined names, formulas, and functions



=CHOOSE(C5,"dog","cat",8,12,15,"hat")

Match 
Match(lookup_value,lookup_array,[match_type])
get the relative position of an item in an arry
Returns an index for the location of an item in an array.
Match("bus",{"car","fly","bus","walk"),false

Index
Index(array,row_num_[column_num])
Index(reference,row_num,[column_num],[area_num])

Get a specific value at the intersection of a particular
row and column or an array of values given a row of column
Specific value of array of values
Index({1,2,3,4,5,6},2,3)
Return 6,since it is the item from the 3rd column
of the 2nd row
String are not case sensitive in match function
0 for exact match
=MATCH(C8,{"Ana","Lokesh","Charles","Sofia","Mark","Hannah","Alexis","Zach"},0)
match function return the position number of the item

Reference Tools: Defined Names
Defined Names represent a cell, range of cells,formula,
or constant value
Why define names in Excel?
Make formula easier to understand and maintain
What's the Scope of Names?
Local Level:
Requires qualitication when used in other worksheet
Workbook Level: No qualification needed
*Names have to  be unique
*Have to begin with a letter or underscore
Names are not case sensitive

Name manager work like a variable in python
where we can store some information into a variable
we can choose scope of the variable 
to local worksheet or workbook level


giving variable names to a table or array 
giving sales2014 to sales list

Offset function
signature
Offset(reference,rows,columns,[height],[width])

By selecting the array and then
using row() we fill the row number of each
respected row.

What is an array?
An array is a collection of values surround by curly
brackets ({1,2,3} or {"a","b","c"} 
Array can be 1 or 2 dimensional 
You can think of Arrays tables with rows and columns
Rows are denoted by ";"
Column are denoted by ","

Example
{1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9}

Why are Array important
Arrays can be used to formula and provided as inputs
to may of Excel's built in functions, which
allows us to expand our capabilities to perform powerful
calculations

A few rules about Array formulas
Must use CSE when editing or entering array formula
For multi-cell formulas you must select the 
range you want you results to go in prior 
to writing the formula
You cannot change the contents of an individual cell
in an array formula
You cannot insert or delete rows or columns 
into the range of a multi-cell array formula.
#Multi cell array

=C8:C19/D8:D19*100
=E8:E19/D8:D19
Position does not matter in array formulas but size matters
